								<h3>My Journey to Data Science in Python</h3>
								<p>When I graduated from my Electronics Engineering department with an honors in my degree,
									I remember asking myself this question: <strong>"which were the courses that I excelled in
										because of mere hardworking, and which of them was I really ENJOYING my time working hard with?"</strong>
									When I had this reflection, I remembered Python projects coming to my mind all of a sudden. Then slowly I started remembering
								the long hours I used to sit working on these projects without feeling the pass of time, or even the time for food! This
								was the state that Python was so good to put me in everytime I worked with it.</p>

								<p>I remember working with tons of different coding languages and softwares including Verilog, MATLAB, C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS,
								and some more, but nothing to me was like working with Python. This why I decided to research potential fields that can
								offer me a decent job with this particular coding language. It was not surprising for me to then find that this language was one of the most
								demanded coding languages in the corporate world, and especially in the field of data science. <br><br>This belief became even more emphasized in me when I started having hands-on experience
								in the data science applications of that language. The power that this language could offer to data science and analysis was
								spectacular in my opinion. I now have no doubt that this is the field that I will be willing to work and research for due to its wonderful combination between the world of mathematics that I love, and the programming language that I admire.</p>
